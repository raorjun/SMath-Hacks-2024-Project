https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Croptimizer is a project developed by Laira L, Meghan L, Stella H, and Arjun R during the SMathhacks 2024 event. It is aimed at helping farmers optimize their crop selection based on various environmental factors using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
Croptimizer leverages the `scikit-learn` machine learning library to build a model that predicts the feasibility of growing crops in an area based on factors such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. By analyzing historical crop data and environmental conditions, Croptimizer provides insights to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions about crop selection for optimal yield.
