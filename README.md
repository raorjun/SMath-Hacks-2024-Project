# SMathhacks-2024-Project - Croptimizer

Croptimizer is a project developed by Laira L, Meghan L, Stella H, and Arjun R during the SMathhacks 2024 event. It is aimed at helping farmers optimize their crop selection based on various environmental factors using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
Croptimizer leverages the scikit-learn machine learning library to build predictive models that recommend the most suitable crop to grow based on factors such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. By analyzing historical crop data and environmental conditions, Croptimizer provides insights to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions about crop selection for optimal yield.
