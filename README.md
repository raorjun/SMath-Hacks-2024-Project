https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Croptimizer is a project developed by Laira L, Meghan L, Stella H, and Arjun R during the SMathhacks 2024 event. It is aimed at helping farmers optimize their crop selection based on various environmental factors using machine learning techniques.

## Overview
Croptimizer leverages the `scikit-learn` machine learning library to build a model that predicts the feasibility of growing crops in an area based on factors such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. By analyzing historical crop data and environmental conditions, Croptimizer provides insights to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions about crop selection for optimal yield.

## How to Use
To use Croptimizer, follow the steps below:
1. If you would like to use the Croptimizer at any area in the world, choose "Predict your Crops" option. Provide your surrounding environmental data and include the temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, nitrogen, potassium (k), and phosphorous. However, note that this database is based off of data from India. Note that units chosen for potassium and phosphorous need to be consistent throughout the data. This data will output feedback regarding recommendations on crops suitable for your soil composition.
2. If you are located in Pakistan, choose "Pakistan Application." This option, specifically made for farmers in this location, will ask solely for your state. This data will output feedback regarding recommendations on crops suitable for your soil composition in your regions.
